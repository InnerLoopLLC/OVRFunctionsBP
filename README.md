#### What this is:
+ ...the [*OculusVR API*](https://developer.oculus.com/reference/) exposed from C++ to Blueprints as directly as possible.
+ ...or at least some of it. A tiny bit of it. Not much, really.

#### What this isn't:
+ ...complete. Most features have **not** been implemented. Because there's no point, frankly.
+ ...useful. The majority of this stuff is unnecessary. It's just neat.

This means you'll find blueprint nodes exposing the C++ functions included in the UE4 OculusVR plugin, but that's pretty much it. Please refer to the [*Oculus documentation*](https://developer.oculus.com/reference/) for information. Many of these features are undocumented, so good luck! Please refer to the [*Unreal Engine 4*](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) GitHub for links and resources related to UE4.
